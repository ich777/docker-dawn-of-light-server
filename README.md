# Dawn of Light Server in Docker optimized for Unraid
This Docker will download and install Dawn of Light Server and run it.

ATTENTION: First Startup can take very long since it downloads the gameserver files!

CONSOLE: To connect to the console open up the terminal on the host machine and type in: 'docker exec -u dol -ti NAMEOFYOURCONTAINER screen -xS DoL' (without quotes) to exit the screen session press CTRL+A and then CTRL+D or simply close the terminal window in the first place.

Update Notice: Simply restart the container if a newer version of the game is available.
